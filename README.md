This project use the linked list data structure, and as many arrays.
and sorting algorithms as bubble (sorry it was my first semester when i do this ;c , Next update we use Quicksort or something else).
In this way we can see the head of list as the "Now listening" song.
That's it hope someone found this project usefull because i dont. :D
